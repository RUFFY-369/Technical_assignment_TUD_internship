# ROS2 package for simulation & control of the modelled robotic arm
This is the ROS2 package for the simulation and control

To run the solution for the exercise 2, one should follow the below mentioned consecutive commands (for
ROS2 package) :

- Launch the required nodes with the provided launch file by executing the following command in the
terminal:
> ros2 launch robotic_arm_1 rrbot_gazebo.launch.py
- Run your ROS2 Node for exercise 2 by executing the following command in the
Terminal:
> ros2 run robotic_arm_1 ex2

To run the same solution for the exercise 2 but on manipulator with soft joints, do as follows:

> ros2 launch robotic_arm_1 rrbot_gazebo_soft.launch.py

> ros2 run robotic_arm_1 ex2
